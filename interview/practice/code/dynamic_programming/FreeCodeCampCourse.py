7 is not base case
7 = fib(5), fib(6)...up to the base case
Visualise this as a tree
Because the levels are equivalent of n, and at each level, the nodes increase by double
We know that the time complexity is O(2**n)
The space complexity is O(n) because we only even have stacks equivalent to n at max
The fibonacci is a good example of a dynamic problem because we see a pattern of duplicate
trees solving the fibonacci.
Memoization is one of the overarching that helps resolve problems using dynamic programming
with memoization, we store the values we have calculated
With memoization, include the memo in the visualisation, showing that in the first instance, the
first branch will calculate the fib, but subsequent calls to fib will use the memoized value

Travel down a 2D grid from top left corner to the bottom right corner. 
You can only travel down or right. 
In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions of m * n
Rectangle not necessarily a square
visualise some simple example
grid_traversal(2,3) => 3
grid_traversal(1,1) => 1 - Do nothing as you are already at the bottom right
grid_traversal(0,1) => 0 - invalid as the grid is zero
if any of the dimensions is zero then there's no path to traverse
grid_traversal(3,3) => 3
Every step towards the bottom right shrinks our problem and grid towards the base case of (1,1)
Every times, structure the problem as a tree to visualise
grid_traversal(2,3) => 3
knowing the result of a simple examples, we can visualise our logic
We know that going down the tree, we have made known decisions of either traversing right or down
and we know the resulting count of ways to the base case
We know we can only either go a step down or a step right which means -1
So every node branches down and right
Time complexity O(2 ** (n+m))
Space is the height of the tree which is O(n+m)
So the issue is the n+m exponent
Pick out the duplicate work
With a brute force solution and recursion, memoization becomes easier
By memoizing, we have reduced our time complexity to O(m * n) and space complexity of O(m+n)

Write a function that takes in a target sum and an array of numbers as arguments. 
The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible 
to generate the target sum using numbers from the array. 
You may use an element of the array as many times as needed. 
You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative.

Taking a simple example, we know that if we subtract 7 away from our target, 
the result will be zero and 4 will result in three of which we can take away 3 
available to us in the array, resulting in  0. 
All the cases which result in a zero are base cases with a positive result 
while any with a remainder means that we could not arrive at the base case of zero 
and thus are a false result. 
The question however, is just looking for a single true. 
So we can return a true soon as we know itâ€™s feasible.

m - target sum
n - length of the array we are given
What is the depth of the tree, this would be m as you have to subtract 1 in the 
 worst case scenario all the way down the tree to the value of m. This is the height of the tree.
 What is the branching factor or breadth of the tree at each level? Every target value could potentially 
 be made up of n factors - all of the factors in the array.
 Time complexity is thus O(n ** m)
 Space complexity will be O(m) the height of the tree
 With the memoized version, the complexity is cut down by our values stored in the memo
 So we never have to go beyond the target sum up to the number of nodes in our array.
 O(m*n)
Space complexity will remain O(m), the height of the tree
