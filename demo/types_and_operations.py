'''
 - The principal Python built in types are:
  >numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.
 - In Python data takes the form of objects and everything is an object.
 - Objects are computer memory with values and associated operations.
 - Built in objects are often more efficient as they employ optimized data structure algorithms implemented in C for speed.
 - Practically every object can be compared for equality, tested for truth value or converted to a string with the repr() or str() function.

'''
x + y   :   sum of x and y
x - y   :   difference of x and y
x * y   :   product of x and y
x / y   :   quotient of x and y
x // y  :   floored quotient of x and y
x % y   :   remainder of x / y
-x      :   x negated
+x      :   x unchanged
abs(x)  :   absolute value or magnitude of x
int(x)  :   x converted to integer
float(x) :  x converted to floating point
complex(re, im) : a complex number with real part re, imaginary part im. im defaults to zero.
c.conjugate() : conjugate of the complex number c
divmod(x, y)
the pair (x // y, x % y)
pow(x, y) : x to the power y
x ** y : x to the power y
